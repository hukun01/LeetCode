Binary search:
1. Define search space
2. Define predicate p and target x so that p(a) < p(x) <= p(b) for a < x <= b

Always test your code on empty, one-element, and two-element sets, to ensure that it doesn't stuck by round-down.

There can be 2 types of search spaces:
1. Index space - where values[index] grow with the index monotonically
2. Value space - where the values[index] doesn't grow monotonically, so we need to find the target value by verifying each candidate, and discard half of the value space each time.
