If finding an existing value in the sequence, use 
    l, h = 0, len(a) - 1
    while l < h
If finding a position of a value in the sequence (the value may not exist), use
    l, h = 0, len(a)
    while l < h

Always test your code on a two-element set, to ensure that it doesn't stuck by round-down.
